# Nospaces — Handoff

**Read this file at session start.** It's deliberately short. Everything else is split out by how often it changes:

| File | What's in it | When to open it |
|---|---|---|
| **`HANDOFF.md`** (this) | Where we are + what's next | every session |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | Open backlog, parked + shelved ideas | picking what to do next |
| `docs/REFERENCE.md` | Stack, env vars, key files, costs, features, architecture, dev hooks | when you need a fact |
| `docs/HANDOFF-archive.md` | Full session-by-session history | rarely — digging up "why did we…" |

## 🚦 Where we are

Personal PWA taste library for Farah + Tom (films, books, music, TV). Live at https://nospaces.vercel.app. Phases 1–4 done; **Phase 5 (discovery + taste) in progress.**

**This session (63):** Built the **regions / country filter** end-to-end (country-only, per the decided plan). `api/wiki.ts` now pulls country of origin (film/TV → work's `P495`; book/music → creator's `P27`) and the title-search branch honours `parse=1`. New `src/lib/regions.ts` one-shot backfill; `LibraryScreen` gets a **"region"** filter group + a **"pull regions"** action in the ⋯ menu; auto-fill captures region for new items. Cost $0 (Wikidata reads). Verified: typecheck + 56 tests + live pull (*Drops of God* → France·Japan·US). **NOT visually verified** (OAuth wall) — eyeball on phone: ⋯ → pull regions. **Not yet pushed.** Full detail → archive.

**Last session (62):** Brought `AddScreen` + `LibraryScreen` up to the Taste/Discover editorial bar (#6 done). Full detail → archive.

## ▶ Next session (64)

**First thing: push s63.** The regions feature is built + verified (typecheck/tests/live pull) but **not pushed**. Confirm it eyeballs right on phone (⋯ → pull regions → check the "region" filter populates), then push to `main`.

**#6 done.** **Regions shipped s63** (country-only). If country alone feels wrong in real use, the language axis (`P364`) is a parked fast-follow → `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

**📅 ~2026-07-14 checkpoint — held decision:**
1. **Taste-tab keep-or-fold** — DECIDED s63: *keep the tab*; revisit after real desert-island use. (Reasoning + profile-as-masthead fold sketch → `docs/ROADMAP.md`.)

Otherwise pick a direction now:
- **Expansion beyond media** (restaurants/places, calendar, the "life index") — bigger/longer-term.
- Smaller carried item (softer PageHeader rule, catalog-miss interstitial decision, the s57 re-checks below).

**Still pending re-check (s57 follow-ups, may already be fine):** Discover blurb titles read upright/distinct; search shows "all" tab highlighted while a query is active.

**Verified earlier — don't re-check:** s56 scroll-restore (cold-kill case) + "new music tuesday"; detail sheet (`SheetHero`); filter-clip bug (session-49 #5).

**Parked from s55:** bigger detail-sheet cover with **real CSS text-wrap** (deferred — body lives outside `SheetHero` + `overflow:hidden` kills wrapping). Page-level **kicker+rule section dividers** (Taste/Library) is a fast-follow if wanted.

**Also still open (smaller, carried from before):**
- **PageHeader 1.5px rule** — if it reads heavy across pages, softer hairline = one-line change in `src/components/PageHeader.tsx`.
- **#7 — catalog-miss interstitial.** "nothing found — identify with ai?" adds a step mid-flow; kept as a cost gate (paid Sonnet). Farah's call whether to make it automatic. (`AddScreen.tsx:367`)
- **Discover mood chips** — parked, revisit **2026-06-29** after a week of real use. (`docs/ROADMAP.md`)

**Don't touch (genuinely good):** decade grouping, the taste page's vibe-headline → prose → gap → always-loved → desert-island arc, the editorial palette, the faithful-creators logic, **the recommendation engine itself.**

Backlog beyond this queue → `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## 🔁 Doc upkeep (the process that keeps this from rotting)

The reason this got messy before: one file did five jobs, history piled up, and the same fact lived in three places (then drifted — session 42 was a whole cleanup). The split above fixes the structure; these rules keep it clean:

1. **One fact, one home.** A status (e.g. "Sentry is live") lives in exactly one file. Elsewhere, link to it — don't restate it.
2. **End of session: log, then prune.** Write the session entry at the **top** of `docs/HANDOFF-archive.md`. If you finished a roadmap item, **delete** it from `docs/ROADMAP.md` (the log is its record — no ✅ graveyard). Update "Where we are" + the Next-session checklist here.
3. **Keep this file one screen.** Session history → archive. Stable facts → reference. Backlog → roadmap. If `HANDOFF.md` is scrolling, something's in the wrong file.
4. **The Stop hooks nudge all of this** (roadmap reminder, handoff staleness/size, guide reminder). They're cues to do the prune, not noise to dismiss. See `docs/REFERENCE.md` → Dev automation.

## 🛠️ Working style

- Farah = product person, not engineer. ELI5, short sentences, no jargon.
- Menus are fine — she decides. Add a recommendation + plain-language why on technical calls.
- Light verification by default. Flag when exhaustive is warranted.
- Flag good moments to start a fresh chat (long sessions = expensive).
- Two billing systems — the Anthropic API key (pay-per-token, $20/mo cap) is separate from this Claude Code subscription. Never burn more than 2–3 test API calls; web_search is the pricey one. See `docs/REFERENCE.md` → API costs.
