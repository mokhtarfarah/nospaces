# Nospaces — Handoff

**Read this file at session start.** It's deliberately short. Everything else is split out by how often it changes:

| File | What's in it | When to open it |
|---|---|---|
| **`HANDOFF.md`** (this) | Where we are + what's next | every session |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | Open backlog, parked + shelved ideas | picking what to do next |
| `docs/REFERENCE.md` | Stack, env vars, key files, costs, features, architecture, dev hooks | when you need a fact |
| `docs/HANDOFF-archive.md` | Full session-by-session history | rarely — digging up "why did we…" |

## 🚦 Where we are

Personal PWA taste library for Farah + Tom (films, books, music, TV) **+ a Things side** (shopping / wishlist). Live at https://nospaces.vercel.app. Phases 1–4 done; **Phase 5 (discovery + taste) in progress.** Things is the active workstream.

**Session 83 — s82 quick-polish batch + domain switcher moved to the bottom, on `main`. 93 Vitest green, typecheck + eslint clean; both domains eyeballed live in the noauth preview.** Closed the whole s82 "quick polish" list (grid covers now use the list row's Wikipedia-thumb fallback; finished `✓` got the smiley's feathered outline; both empty-states are header+small-line; uncramped the Things CTAs) **and** the nav-placement decision: the media/things `DomainSwitcher` is now a slim hairline strip pinned just above the bottom tab bar (rendered once in `App.tsx`, removed from all 5 screens), with every bottom-anchored offset shifted up by `SWITCHER_H=40`. Full detail → archive (s83). **Not yet seen with real data:** grid-covers + done-badge (need a populated library) and the +40px scrolled-content clearance — worth a glance live next login.

## ▶ Next session (84) — open: pick from the roadmap

No fixed queue. The big remaining taste item is gated on a decision with Farah:
- **"What feeds the taste read"** — the consolidated design decision (self-defined taste + Things-taste reframe + beauty/home exclusion + a "got it"→worth-it signal). **Gated:** decide the feedback loop *with Farah first*, honouring the "saving is the signal" soul rule. No code until decided.

Ungated alternatives if she's not ready to decide the above: the **user-guide overhaul** (stale + media-only — split into media/things tabs, refresh screenshots; own session, free); the **capture pain points** (iOS share-shortcut email path, image-share, paywalled-article extraction — own session, mostly free); or the **scraper-403 fingerprint** real-world check (does a previously-403 shop read now?).

**For-discussion (parked, in `docs/ROADMAP.md` → "Media library polish"):** scroll-lock stickiness (needs a switcher-accessibility call); music-library clutter (pair with the verdict reshape).

**Things model facts:** all on `Item`; `type:'thing'`; `metadata.kind` = `product`|`intent`|`inspiration` (mood-board image); `metadata.attributes[]` (`{facet,value}`) is the composition engine; a promoted plan keeps `metadata.fromPlan` (reversible via `demoteProductToIntent`); resolve = `done` + winner flag, **no archive** (losers persist). The taste read runs over wishlist + mood together (`tasteItems`).

**Don't touch (genuinely good):** decade grouping; the taste page's vibe-headline → prose → gap → always-loved → desert-island arc; the editorial palette; the faithful-creators logic; **the recommendation engine itself.** (All re-confirmed in the s81 review.)

Backlog beyond this → `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## 🔁 Doc upkeep (the process that keeps this from rotting)

The reason this got messy before: one file did five jobs, history piled up, and the same fact lived in three places (then drifted — session 42 was a whole cleanup). The split above fixes the structure; these rules keep it clean:

1. **One fact, one home.** A status (e.g. "Sentry is live") lives in exactly one file. Elsewhere, link to it — don't restate it.
2. **End of session: log, then prune.** Write the session entry at the **top** of `docs/HANDOFF-archive.md`. If you finished a roadmap item, **delete** it from `docs/ROADMAP.md` (the log is its record — no ✅ graveyard). Update "Where we are" + the Next-session checklist here.
3. **Keep this file one screen.** Session history → archive. Stable facts → reference. Backlog → roadmap. If `HANDOFF.md` is scrolling, something's in the wrong file.
4. **The Stop hooks nudge all of this** (roadmap reminder, handoff staleness/size, guide reminder). They're cues to do the prune, not noise to dismiss. See `docs/REFERENCE.md` → Dev automation.

## 🛠️ Working style

- Farah = product person, not engineer. ELI5, short sentences, no jargon.
- Menus are fine — she decides. Add a recommendation + plain-language why on technical calls.
- Light verification by default. Flag when exhaustive is warranted.
- Flag good moments to start a fresh chat (long sessions = expensive).
- Two billing systems — the Anthropic API key (pay-per-token, $20/mo cap) is separate from this Claude Code subscription. Never burn more than 2–3 test API calls; web_search is the pricey one. See `docs/REFERENCE.md` → API costs.
